<h1>Planning a Drone Mapping Campaign</h1>
<p>Imagine yourself the Director of a nature reserve. You get an email - an instructor of a field methods class at the local university is offering to send you a group of graduate students to spend a week at your reserve to map the entire property with drones. That’s an offer that’s hard to pass up, but how do you even start to plan such a campaign? Using drones to map even a small area, with a single drone and pilot, involves a complicated workflow with a lot of moving parts. Coordinating multiple teams with multiple drones within a fix time frame adds even more complexity - particularly if you want to get good data!</p>
<p>This chapter offers some guidelines and thoughts for planning a drone campaign spanning multiple days and/or multiple flight teams. These lessons are based on our collective experiences including a campaign to map &gt;2000 acres of the Hopland Research and Extension Center, a xxx acre reserve in Mendicino County, California, most of which is extremely hilly oak woodland.</p>
<p>Staffing</p>
<p>When thinking about how many flight teams you can deploy, a general rule of thumb is to allocate two people per aircraft. At least one of person in each flight group needs to be an experienced drone pilot, familiar with the equippment and holding a FAA Part 107 remote pilot license. At least one assistant is needed to help with the many other tasks needed during the field work - packing and unpacking equipment, helping with launch and landing, keeping an eye open for hazards on the ground or in the air, transferring and checking data, etc. If the assistant(s) are novices (we all have to start somewhere), having two assistants per flight team would be wise, at least for the first couple days of the campaign.</p>
<p>In theory the pilot can perform these tasks herself, but you want your pilot to be fresh and focused on the mission planning, flight, and overall safety environment. If you have multiple teams sharing a single launch location (hopefully in different directions), you might be able to share an assistant across flights, but only if they’re fairly experienced and physically fit!</p>
<p>It goes without saying that communication within a flight team is critical, and each team should do some practice flights <em>before</em> you’re actually collecting the research data.</p>
<p>Timeline</p>
<p>Big Picture</p>
<p>Key tasks 2-3 months before the campaign</p>
<p>clear articulation of the 1) science questions, and 2) data requirements (e.g., RGB, multispectral, and/or thermal, spatial resolution, area of interest, spatial accuracy). If this is difficult, that’s a yellow flag that maybe you’re collecting data for the sake of collecting data. Rethink!</p>
<p>Assess regulatory requirements, apply for any permissions or waviers.</p>
<p>Inventory your equipment - don’t forget the accessories</p>
<p>The week before the campaign</p>
<p>Day-to-day Schedule DUring the Campaign</p>
<p>During fieldwork, the default schedule is to wake up early, head out to your field site as soon as possible, and work until the sun goes down or your energy is gone - whichever comes first! Sleep, wakeup, and repeat.</p>
<p>Dawn-to-dusk is a poor objective for drone mapping fieldwork. Capturing data (i.e., flying the drone) is an essential but relatively small percentage of the overall workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>after each day of flights, you should have 2-4 hours to put data in the folders,
create metadata, hopefully do some preliminary stitching, and plan flight areas for the
following day. If it isn’t practical to do this at the end of the day, then you should
take a day off inbetween flight days, or plan 1/2 day flight days.</li>
</ul>
<p>T-1 month</p>
<p>Field reconnaissance</p>
<p>How many flights, how many days, and where are you going to launch?</p>
<p>T minus 1 week</p>
<p>Training</p>
<p>T-2 months. Inventory your field equipment, and order what you need.</p>
<p>Field Accessories
field table (one per flight team)
pop-up shade structure (one per flight team)
a power supply or generator capable of powering a laptop</p>

<p>Drone Accessories</p>
<p>Memory Cards Aim for enough memory cards for the number of flights a team will do each day. This way, the memory cards can serve as backup and you don’t have to reformat the memory cards between flights. We like 32GB memory cards, because they’re relatively cheap and have more than enough capacity to hold the images from a multi-spectral camera from a fixed wing drone (i.e., as much as we’ll ever collect on a single flight0.</p>
<p>Memory Card cases / labels / holder. Typically when the drone lands you pull off the memory card and give it to someone who is in charge of the precious data. After a couple of flights, there are a bunch of memory cards sitting on someone’s laptop, pocket, etc. and they all start to look the same. Sharpies, stickers, labels, and cases can help keep this organized and make sure they don’t mixed up or accidentally erased.</p>

<p>How Many Flights Do We Need?</p>
<p>How Many Days Do We Need?</p>
<p>Short answer: more than you think!</p>
<p>Start</p>
<p>Field Reconnaisance</p>
<p>======================
Field Equipment
- table and pop-up are really helpful
- for multiple aircraft going at one time,
- you really need one PIC per aircraft
- plus at least one runner / helper
- need a memory card manager to help keep track of those, labels and plenty of extras
so you don’t have to format them
-
- leather boots and gaiters to prevent grasse
- keep #2 coffee filters and cone in vehicle at all times
- the RockPal power packs are a great idea
- umbrella is helpful, but needs to be sturdy
- laptop field case (pellican case style)
-
- pole for the modem
- pack a first aid kit</p>
<p>Field Lunch Food
- apples, cheese sticks, crackers</p>
<p>Scheduling
- training and research data collection should be separate
- different goals, different amounts of time
- first half day should be training and orientation of the field crew
- plan a half-day break after the first day to go over the data.
- after each day of flights, you should have 2-4 hours to put data in the folders,
create metadata, hopefully do some preliminary stitching, and plan flight areas for the
following day. If it isn’t practical to do this at the end of the day, then you should
take a day off inbetween flight days, or plan 1/2 day flight days.</p>
<p>Staffing
- two people per drone
- a helper could split between two drones
- the most experienced person should be under-occupied so he/she can have a high-level
view.
- a media person who is not a mapping lead</p>
<p>Consider a Workshop on Mission Planning for Natural Resource Applications
- show people Google Earth profile tool
-</p>
